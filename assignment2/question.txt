create a npm project and install Express.js(nodemon if you want)
create an express.js app which funnels the requests through 2 middleware fxns that log something to console and return one response
comment out any one middleware and handle requests to '/' and '/users' such that each request only has one middleware
that does something with it(send dummy respone)
